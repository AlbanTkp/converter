# converter
We are interested in the design of an interface allowing to carry out several types of
conversion namely: Currency (fcfa, dollars, euros, etc.), measurements (cm, m, km, etc), and coding (decimal,
binary, etc). The interface must contain:
<ul>
   <li>
     Elements allowing you to choose the type of conversion (currency, measure, or
     coding)
   </li>
   <li>
     Areas for entering the value to convert, as well as the result.
   </li>
   <li>
     Elements allowing you to make the different selections for the input and the result:
     dinar, cm, m, etc.
   </li>
     <li>An element to perform the conversion, and another to close the interface.</li>
  </ul>
